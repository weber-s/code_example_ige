# Code example for science at IGE

This documentation aims to help students and researcher in the field of "environmental"
geosciences to produce useful graph.

Most of us tried during hours to plot a kind of graph that someone else already plotted (windrose, map, etc.). Why not simply share code and save us hours or days?

This is the purpose of this documentation.

Everyone is welcome: from the basic of file manipulation and plot,
to more complex GIS plots with `basemap` for instance.

Please, feel free to contribute!

For now, the site is hosted at https://pmall.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/docs, but it
should migrate at some point.
