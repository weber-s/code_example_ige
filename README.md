# Code example for science at IGE

This documentation aims to help students and researcher in the "environment"
geosciences to produce useful graph.

Most of use tried during hours to plot a kind of graph something that someone else already plotted. Why not simply share code?

This is the purpose of this documentation.

Everyone is welcome: from the basic of file manipulation and plot,
to more complex GIS plots with `basemap` for instance.

Please, feel free to contribute!

For now, the site is hosted at https://pmall.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/docs, but it
should migrate at some point.
